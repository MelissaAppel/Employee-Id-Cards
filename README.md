Application that creates employee identification cards from python data.
Users.py takes array of dictionaries and exports the data as a JSON. Swift imports JSON data into program and uses it to display employee identification cards.

IMPORTANT:
In ViewController.swift, line 15, project directory must be manually added for application to import JSON file in accessible location. 

Screenshots of how application looks are in project folder as well as icons in Screenshots.xcassets
